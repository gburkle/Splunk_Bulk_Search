Splunk Bulk Search

This is an interactive script that will make use of a provided file listing IP addresses and/or URL's and search your instance of Splunk for them "one by one".

This script relies 100% on splunk-sdk and REST API. (http://dev.splunk.com/sdks) 

There might be a better way to go about this, but I decided to code the script to get back into Python Scripting.
